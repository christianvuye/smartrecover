# SmartRecover System Architecture

## System Overview
SmartRecover is a **technical demonstration platform** showcasing production-quality microservices architecture, algorithmic processing, and operational monitoring patterns for software engineering interviews.

## Service Definitions

### Risk Assessment Service
**Purpose**: Demonstrate efficient algorithmic processing of large datasets using priority queue data structures.

**Core Responsibilities**:
- Calculate composite scores using hash map-based risk factors
- Process large datasets (15K+ records) using heap-based priority queues for O(log n) performance
- Demonstrate batch processing patterns for memory management
- Show error handling and operational metrics collection

**Technical Implementation**:
- Django application with Debtor and RiskScore models
- BulkProcessor class using Python heapq for priority queue operations
- Management commands for data generation and processing
- Database: SQLite (development) / MySQL (production)

**Interview Value**: Demonstrates understanding of efficient data structures, algorithmic complexity, and scalable processing patterns.

### Partner Sync Service  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate distributed systems architecture and data reconciliation patterns between microservices.

**Core Responsibilities**:
- Receive messages from Risk Service via SQS (event-driven architecture)
- Simulate data synchronization with external systems
- Demonstrate automated discrepancy detection and resolution
- Show exception handling and manual review workflows

**Technical Implementation**:
- Django application with PartnerSyncRecord and DiscrepancyRecord models
- SQS message processing for service decoupling
- Simulated partner data with realistic variances
- Rule-based reconciliation engine with audit trails

**Interview Value**: Shows understanding of distributed systems, service communication patterns, and financial data reconciliation.

## Service Interaction

```
Risk Service → SQS Queue → Partner Sync Service
     ↓                            ↓
Priority Processing         Data Reconciliation
     ↓                            ↓
Algorithmic Demo           Integration Patterns
```

**Message Flow**:
1. Risk Service processes debtor records demonstrating heap algorithms
2. Sends messages to SQS queue: `{debtor_id, debt_amount, risk_score}`
3. Partner Sync Service receives messages demonstrating event-driven architecture
4. Shows reconciliation patterns with simulated partner data

## Interview Demonstration Points

**Distributed Systems**: Two decoupled services communicating via message queues  
**Algorithms**: Heap-based priority processing, rule-based reconciliation  
**AWS Integration**: SQS messaging, CloudWatch monitoring  
**Operational Engineering**: Error handling, batch processing, audit trails  
**System Design**: Event-driven architecture, service separation of concerns  
**Data Reconciliation**: Financial system patterns for data consistency

## Scope Boundaries

**In Scope**:
- Core algorithmic processing demonstrations
- Basic AWS integration (SQS, CloudWatch)  
- Automated reconciliation logic patterns
- Simple monitoring and alerting
- **Basic Kubernetes deployment**

**Out of Scope**:
- Complex ML algorithms
- Real partner API integrations
- Advanced fraud detection
- Production-scale optimizations
